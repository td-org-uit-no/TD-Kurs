## Introduction to DIY Keyboards

- Focus on building from scratch
- E.g. hand wired, not pcb or kits
- Split is easier to DIY

---

## Options for Obtaining a Keyboard Case

2. **Generating a Case Using Tools**
3. **Designing a Case from Scratch or Editing in CAD**

---

### Option 3: Designing a Case in CAD

- **CAD Software**: Fusion 360, FreeCAD

- **Materials**: Plastic, aluminum, acrylic
  - Feel, weight, and sound
- **Manufacturing Methods**:
  - 3D Printing 
  - CNC Machining
    - PCBWay.com
  - **Laser Cutting**: Fast, accurate for flat designs

---

## Designing the case:

- Choose layout
- Get or make a plate
  - http://builder.swillkb.com/
  - No kerf for 3d printing
- Cherry MX
  - Most common style of switches
  - https://www.cherry.de/en-gb/gaming/developer
  - Official sizes:
    - 19.05mm between center of holes
    - 14mmx14mm holes
    - Probably should be 14.1mm
    - 1.5mm for plate thickness
      - Depending on the fit you can increase this to stiffen the plate
        But the keys will not snap in place
- M3 or M4 screws are most readily available in local stores
- For other fasteners AliExpress is good enough

---

## Making the case

- Using Fusion360
  - Free for students
- Remember cutout for USB

---

## Printing the case

- PLA is easier to print with
- PETG less creep over time
- ABS or other "fancy" Materials are Probably not needed
- Use bambulab studio
- put file on microSD card
